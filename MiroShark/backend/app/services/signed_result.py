"""HMAC-signed trading-signal payload — offline-verifiable provenance for
a finished, published simulation.

The signal returned by ``GET /api/simulation/<id>/signal.json`` is the
canonical machine-readable view of the final-round belief split + quality
tier. HTTPS covers in-transit authenticity — but once a caller stores the
payload (Capacitr's settlement ledger, a research archive, an ML pipeline's
provenance table) there is no way to prove the stored bytes match what
MiroShark actually emitted without making a live API call back to the
deployment.

``build_signed_result`` returns the same signal fields wrapped in a
canonical envelope plus an HMAC-SHA256 signature over the deterministic
JSON encoding of the inner ``result`` block. The signing key is the same
``WEBHOOK_SECRET`` the outbound delivery service reads — zero new config,
zero new secrets, identical algorithm + prefix as the
``X-MiroShark-Signature`` webhook header.

Two consequences of that choice:

* **Anyone who can already verify a webhook can verify a stored signal.**
  The recipient-side ``hmac.compare_digest`` / ``crypto.timingSafeEqual``
  logic an integrator wrote for the webhook handler is the same logic
  they re-use here.
* **Deterministic canonical JSON.** ``json.dumps(result, sort_keys=True,
  separators=(",", ":"))`` produces a byte string a recipient can
  reconstruct exactly from the parsed ``result`` dict — no whitespace
  drift, no key reordering, no trailing newline ambiguity. The signature
  is computed over that canonical encoding, not over the response body
  the route handler emits (which carries the envelope's ``signed_at``,
  ``algorithm``, ``signing_key_hint`` + the signature itself).

Design notes
------------

* **Pure stdlib.** ``hmac`` + ``hashlib`` + ``json``. Zero new
  dependencies — same posture as ``signal_service`` /
  ``surfaces_catalog`` / every pure-data module in this tree.
* **Never raises on the missing-secret path.** If ``WEBHOOK_SECRET`` is
  empty or unset, the function returns the inner ``result`` block plus
  ``signed=false`` + a human-readable error string. Callers translate
  this into a 200 with an explicit ``signed=false`` flag, not a 500 —
  the un-signed payload is still useful (it carries the same fields as
  ``signal.json``); the absence of a signature is the missing feature,
  not an API failure.
* **Same publish gate as signal.json.** The route handler short-circuits
  to 403 for private sims and 404 for not-yet-ready sims *before* this
  service is called. This module does not enforce the gate — it derives
  the signature over whatever signal it's given.
* **Algorithm identifier locked.** The ``algorithm`` envelope field is
  the literal string ``"hmac-sha256"`` — a future migration to a different
  primitive (HS256 → Ed25519, say) would bump the field and add a
  ``schema_version`` boundary; today, v1 is the only published version.
